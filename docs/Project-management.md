## Definition of steps

### Upstream steps

#### Project breakdown

Break down the project into stages, as appropriate:
* Too simple: risk of forgetting important elements
* Too detailed: unmanageable / waste of time

#### The project's objectives

Same characteristics as the indicators: SMART
* Specific
* Measurable
* Attainable
* Realistic
* Temporal

#### Project scope

* Accurate
* Depending on other current and future projects
* Avoid redundancies
* Realistic

#### Definition of deliverables

A deliverable is any result, document, measurable, tangible or verifiable, which results from the completion of part of the project or project (specifications, document, training support, total or part tool, ...)
* In line with objectives
* Defined precisely
* According to sponsors and users
* Identified delivery time

#### Complexity analysis - Controlling risks

Project = risk taking = world of uncertainties => Risk management
* Risk identification: mapping
* Prioritization
* Preventive actions
* Evaluation
* Scalable and dynamic during the life of the project

Identify the risks = factors of project failure
* In relation to the objectives of the project
* Validated
* Shared by stakeholders

Multi-domain risks:
* Strategic: no commitment to management, lack of resources, no budget, opponents (cf. strategy of the allies) ...
* Management: demotivation, team disorganization
* Technical
* External resources: subcontractors, deadlines, poor workmanship
* Financial
* Marketing: final solution not adapted to the client
* Legal

## Actions to be taken

### To do-list

Action => result

Characterized by :
* A specific and measurable goal
* Appropriate human, material and financial resources
* A workload (expressed in number of days / man)
* A fairly short duration (<or = 15 days)
* A start date, an end date

## Tools

* Functional analysis
* "Todo list", tasks to do
* PERT diagram: interdependence of tasks
* Network of antecedents

### Functional analysis

#### Principle - Objective

Structure the project
Divide the project (technical and human) into lots and sub-lots
Use of project management framework:
* Project
* Activities
* Tasks
* Sub tasks 

#### Description of tasks - Process approach

An input: often deliverable previous task
One output: deliverable
A duration: start and end date
Actors: pilot, production
A workload: d / man
Resources needed

#### Identification and interdependence of tasks

Chronological sequence
Task dependency
Estimated duration
Estimation of workloads

#### Estimation of workloads

By activity and task
Workload not necessarily correlated with task duration
Distribute the workload between the actors of the project according to the "RACI" matrix
* R = Realize
* A = Approves (valid and vouch)
* C = is Consulted (before)
* I = is Informed (after)

#### RACI

Each task must have at least one pilot and one implementation actor 

| Domaine | Tâche | Acteur 1 | Acteur 2 | Acteur 3 | Acteur 4 |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Gestion des risques|Suivre les non conformités et les analyser | I | A | R | |
|Audits|Réaliser les audits| I | A | R | |
|Pilotage|Réaliser les revues de direction|A|R | |

#### Leveling by loads

Overall value = duration x intensity
According to the tasks:
Leveling possible:
1 week at 100% = 2 weeks at 50%
The load remains the same
Leveling not possible: "fixed duration" tasks

### To-do list

#### Principle - Objective

Develop the list and distribution of tasks
Use of project management framework
Level of difficulty of use: easy
When?
* In the launch phase
* Updated during deployment

How?
* "Red thread / check list" checked during project team meetings
* Possible combination with PERT and antecedents network

#### Presentation

|Objectif|Tâche|Pilote ou « RACI »|Date de début prévue ou effective|Date de réalisation attendue ou réelle|Suivi|Niveau alerte|
|Objectif 1|Tâche 1|Mr X|15/1/2014|30/3/2014|Déroulement conforme au 04/03/14| |
|P |Tâche 2|Mme Y|15/1/2014|30/12/2014|Pas commencé au 04/03/14| |
|Objectif 2|Tache 1|Mr X|1/3/2014|15/03/2014|Achevé le 10/03/14 | |

#### Choice of actors

Client = buyer of the project product; he assumes the direction of the project.
Project manager = person committed, vis-à-vis the project owner, to the proper completion of the project.
Project manager = person responsible, by the project manager, for the proper completion of the project with the resources allocated to him

In relation to the assessed needs:
* Client Sponsor / User
* Decision-making Management (s), sponsors
* Steering Project manager, coordinator
* Realization Project team (multidisciplinary) - Partners
* Use End users

#### Appointment of the project leader - pilot

* Responsibility for the progress of the project
* Project management
* Validates and implements action plans
* Ensures that the schedule and budget are respected
* Manage the project team
* Communicates both internally and externally
* Technical, managerial, negotiation, communication and… project management skills

#### Constitution of the project team

Limited lifespan = duration of the project
Limited number of people
Multi disciplinary, multi professional: skills and visions
complementary
Transversality; Operation outside the hierarchy (except // pilot)
Common spirit, objectives, approach
No conflicts of interest
Jointly responsible
Expertise
Techniques
Functional
Available!

#### Types of meetings during projects

Launch meeting
Steering meeting - with sponsors and pilots
Point point; gap analysis
Project group meeting - whole project team
Regular point (weekly) - follow-up of the progress, problematic points encountered
Technical meeting - some project team members, problematic experts
Communication meeting

#### GANTT Calendar

Global time scale
Graphic and temporal representation of phases, tasks, resources ...
Lines = tasks
Column = time
Benefits :
Very simple
No need for a specific tool
Limit :
Interrelationships between not / barely visible tasks

### Stages of realization

Project implementation
Management commitment
Formalized
Deployment
According to schedule
Monitoring
Ongoing, by pilot & project team
Validation of deliverables
Evaluation
Regular, according to the schedule
Back to sponsors and users
Adaptation if necessary of the project

### Cross-cutting steps

Resource management
* Human
* Materials
* Financial

Cross-cutting steps

Budget management
* Initial estimate
* Expenditures ; per task, cumulative
* Continue and finish the project
* Responsibility // funder

Communication
* Initial communication plan
* Launch; Name of the project ; Logo
* Intermediate steps
* Transparency
* Project valuation
* Reassure users

Project monitoring - Steering
Gap analysis
Do not look for a scapegoat
Understanding the causes
Objectives: too many? ill-defined?
Resources (human, material, financial)
possible unavailability situations?
Time: sufficient?
Skills: sufficient?
Tools: suitable?
Follow-up: sufficient?
Motivation of the teams: sustained?

### Post-project stages

Project closure
* Balance // expected
Achievement of objectives
Deliverables obtained
Resources committed
Budget
User satisfaction
* Debriefing with the project team; thanks
* Obtain experience feedback; capitalize on team level and institutionally
