# Best practice guidelines for reviewing jobs

# Capture metrics and when you find areas of jobs to change, count them

* Use t-shirt size classification.
* It’s important to try and quantify the impact of your review sessions.
* Track your defects and see if your review efforts are paying off with fewer defects making it past the review process. Capture how long your reviews take.

# Don’t review too many jobs at one time

* In fact, don’t even review too much of the same job at one time if it is complex.
* Take your time to understand the job design and patterns.

# Keep your jobs well described and annotated to ease the review process

* Without a description, you will have to consult each component of the job to know what is done. And it can take a long time.

# Label your components, data flows and subjobs

If we leave the technical names on the components, on the flows, on the sub jobs, logging quickly becomes tedious.

tMsSqlInput1, tMsSqlInput2, output1, output2, input1, input2 ... are not very userfriendly terms.

# Document poor patterns and create a watch list for future job reviews

We cannot review everything from top to bottom. We can keep it aside for the next review.

# Create and share your discovered best practices

Sharing knowledge is important within the team. This makes it possible to disseminate good practices and simplify the resumption of work between developers. Everyone works the same way, it's still easier.

# Be sure to include a feedback mechanism built into your process so that the recommended changes and defect resolution can be implemented on schedule

* Talend job reviews should be part of your development process, and should not be rushed in as an afterthought.
